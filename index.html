        <p>
          Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the
          Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius
          of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth
          the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn
          is over 95 times more massive.

              Nine Earths side by side would almost span Saturn’s diameter. That
              doesn’t include Saturn’s rings.

            <p class="card-para">
              Saturn is the sixth planet from our Sun (a star) and orbits at a
              distance of about 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers) from
              the Sun.

            <p class="card-para">
              Saturn takes about 10.7 hours (no one knows precisely) to rotate
              on its axis once—a Saturn “day”—and 29 Earth years to orbit the
              sun.

            <h1 class="card-heading">Gas Giant</h1>
            <p class="card-para">
              Saturn is a gas-giant planet and therefore does not have a solid
              surface like Earth’s. But it might have a solid core somewhere in
              there.

            <p class="card-para">
              Saturn has the most spectacular ring system, with seven rings and
              several gaps and divisions between them.

              Saturn cannot support life as we know it, but some of Saturn's
              moons have conditions that might support life.
